      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        Founded in 2023, Shropshire Roots Brotherhood began with the vision of
        creating a safe and supportive space for men to connect, grow, and lead.
        Co-founded originally by Wilfred Grainger and his brother-in-law Ben,
        the organization quickly became a vital resource for men seeking
        community and personal development. What started as a small, local
        initiative has grown into a network of men committed to making a
        lasting, positive impact on their lives and the lives of those around
        them. In 2023, we expanded our reach by integrating with local services
        to support social prescription initiatives.

      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        Our mission is to build a supportive, non-judgmental community dedicated
        to enhancing the mental well-being and overall health of men. Through
        genuine conversations, transformative activities, and a deep connection
        with nature, we nurture strength through vulnerability and resilience.
        We are committed to empowering men to become the best versions of
        themselves, contributing to a stronger, healthier society.
