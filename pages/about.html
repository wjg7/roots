      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        Founded in 2023, Shropshire Roots Brotherhood began with the vision of creating a safe and supportive space for men to connect, grow, and lead. Co-founded originally by Wilfred Grainger and his brother-in-law Ben, the organization quickly became a vital resource for men seeking community and personal development. What started as a small, local initiative has grown into a network of men committed to making a lasting, positive impact on their lives and the lives of those around them. In 2023, we expanded our reach by integrating with local services to support social prescription initiatives.
